;; equality is not respected and will trigger if you e.g. pass in a vec of
;; strings as props and need to depend on that inside of an effect.
;;
;; We can work around this by assigning the previous deps to a ref, and do
;; our own equality check to see if they have changed. If so, we update the
;; ref to equal the current value.
;;
;; We can then just pass this one value into e.g. `useEffect` and it will only
;; change if Clojure's equality detects a difference.
